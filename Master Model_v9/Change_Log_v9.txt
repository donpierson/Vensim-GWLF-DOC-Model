Now have added two new lu subgroups
   lu DOC dryland - these are the lu categories that could be expected to mainly contribute
				    DOC by sub surface pathways.  mainly forest and grassland s
					
   lu DOc wetland - these are the lu categories that are wet standing or saturated soils
			         wetland bogs and marsh.  It is expected that these are not contributing
					 to sub surface DOC, but are contributing through direct runoff and runoff
					 delayed as channel flow.  Decomposition into wetlands is only temperature
					 dependent and is greater that in the dryland soils.
					 
I have eliminated using the ratio of surface soil storage to total water column storage since
The SWC can be quite different from catchment to catchment.  For dry lands there is now just a 
fixed ratio between DOC loss from surface and subsurface processes that can be calibrated

The annual loss of DOC g m2 y-1 is now calculated for both the wetland and dryland lu 
categories.  Dryland is presently at about 3-4 g m2 y-1 based on the lase v8 calibration the wetland
is now set at about 20-30 g m2 y-1 based on the map from the AGU presentation.

I cannot think of a way to avoid this.  I considered using the
ratio of runoff/max runoff, but then the C store will never be drawn down to 0.  However the 
effects of previous storms should prevail since they will draw down the store and what remains 
will be drawn down next time.

Loss of DOC from surface runoff is still dependent on a presumed storage of DOC in either the 
upper soil layer or the wetland. The loss of stored surface DOC is based on the potential 
contributing area which is defined by the ratio of runoff volume/rain melt depth. Quick check 
suggests that the contributing area will only occasionally exceed the total land area so the 
store will not be emptied at every storm.  Also this avoids the need for the surface soil 
depth parpameter that was in model V8.  It seems better since it is based on actual physical lu 
areas and no additional parameters are required

I now fixed two equations that caused a divide by zero error when the wetland lu was 0 
See the excel sheet for more detail. The two equations were for the variables C loss Wetland Soils
and Areal Yearly Mean Total Wetland C

2024-01-31 Don
Clean up and DOC model 2 diagram a bit (still more to do) by removing unused variables and 
I also calculated the Unsat Sat and Deep Sat C storage normalized to area (g/m2)

2024-02-09 Don
Improved some comments added a few new variables to server as payoff in DOC calibrations

2024-02-09 Ricardo
1.On the Optimizing view - Point Meas DOC variable was added, this is equal to Meas DOC but gets rid of "0" measurements of DOC in case they are in the input DOC dataset
2.On the DOC 2 view - C loss surface corr was added. This correction factor has influence on both C loss Wetland Soils and C loss Surface Soils
3.On the DOC 2 view - Total C loss Surface Runoff equation was modified, from: C loss Surface Soils+C loss Wetland Soils, to: (C loss Surface Soils+C loss Wetland Soils)*MIN(runoff lu DOC, SAT CAP)
4 On the DOC 2 view - DOC Channel Coeff was added. This to have an independent coefficient regulatin the C loss Channel flow.

2024-02-19 Don
I made a small change to the hydrology model so like the sat zone the deep sat zone always
retains a minimal amount of water (presently 1cm).  This was done to prevent unrealistic concentration 
spikes in DOC concentration.  Also some additional variables added to the calibration view.

2024-02-23 Don
Improved the organization and commenting of DOC variables on the optimization view.  Added 
agricultural land use to DOC lu and also to Dryland DOC lu

2024-03-01 Don
Fixed error in calculation of wetland and dryland runoff (from slack below)
	 I have discovered an error in the surface runoff portion of the V9 model.  It has to do with
	 the calculation of runoff DOC dryland Soils m3 or similarly runoff DOC wetland Soils.
	 
	 As an example for the dryland case the original equation was
	 
		SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC dryland!])*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000
		
	Where what I now believe the correct equation should be	
	
		SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC dryland!]*AREA LU[lu DOC dryland!])/ SUM ( AREA LU[lu DOC dryland!] )*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000
		
		
	
	The difference is that in the second equation the runoff from each landuse (cm) is not just summed but a area weighted mean 
	value is calculated.  Then the final part of the equation (*Area DOC dryland Soils*10000) converts cm/day 
	to m3/day.  It is also confusing with the units since AREA LU is in ha, but Area DOC dryland Soils is 
	converted to km2 
	
Also made the wetland and dryland contributing areas explicit variabled to allow better visualization.
Added the possibility of basing the proportion of available DOC lost from dryland surface runoff based
on loss ratios from the hydrologic model.

2024-03-24 Don
Some additions calculations of the optimization view.  Some cleaning and rearranging but core model should not have
Changed

2024-03-27 Don
Change was made to the the calculations of fast and slow gw flow.  There was an error related
to the addtion of a min storage value.  Flow was set to 0 when the zone level was less that the
minimal storage, and normally calculated otherwise.  This meand that fast gw is the storage * the
recession coeff.  This is wrong at small storage levels since the flow would be based on the total
storage in the zone and results in a larger than expected spike flow.  The correct equation should
be (storage-minimal storage) * the recession coeff  This remove only the excess water from the 
zone storage.

Also added calculation of Avaliable C in surface dryland and wetland soils in g/m2 

2024-03-30
Added a few new optimisation variables to the hydrologic model that will allow the sat zone 
initial water levels to be set to the max (Unsat and deep sat) or mean (sat) level of the 
simulation step

2024-04-04
changed the calculation of Available C Surface dryland soils gm2 and Available C Surface wetland soils gm2
to use ZIDZ to avoid crash when one of these land uses (usually wetlands) are zero.  Similarly also Changed
to ZIDZ in the calculation of runoff DOC wetland Soils m3 and runoff DOC dryland Soils m3.  

2024-04-30
Fixed a bug in the calculation of surface runoff using ZIDZ as described above

The model equations was
runoff DOC wetland Soils m3 =
ZIDZ(SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC wetland!]*AREA LU[lu DOC wetland!]), SUM (AREA LU[lu DOC wetland!])*Area DOC wetland Soils*10000)

Where is should be
ZIDZ(SUM(runoff lu[lu DOC wetland!]*AREA LU[lu DOC wetland!]), SUM (AREA LU[lu DOC wetland!]))*Area DOC wetland Soils*10000

Look at the last ) on the right.  This was misplaced and caused the calculated runoff to be much too low.
  
2024-05-18
Changed the scaling of DOC surface runoff from wetland and dryland areas to be based on the ratio of the event 
runoff to the max measured runoff.  Also added a section in the model that calculated the max runoff based on
a long-term calibration hydrologic model simulation. Fixed some errors related to dividing by 0 when there was
zero wetland LU.  Removed some old equations regarding the earlier formulation of surface DOC loss that were in 
the text view but not in the sketch view

2024-05-26
When testing the above model with opt method 4 I discovered that some variables that I had added to some versions
of the model were no longer there, probably since I had not yet committed them to GIT so I added them back these were 
the conc of DOC in slow and fast Gw and the min measured interp DOC concentration.  I also added an additional optimization
function that should be useful for adjusting the initial conditions of the sat zone to avoid a long spinup

2024-05-29
Add variables in the optimization view that allow the final best initial hydrology zone levels to be estimated and 
output as a CIN which can be used to set the initial conditions for the DOC optimization.

2024-06-02 
Added as single (factor andecomp multiplier) that will simultaneously adjust the andecomp of dryland and wetland decomp
The idea is to use this in the early calibration step that adjusts the decomposition so that the C mass balance is correct.

2024-06-06
Made some small changes to INPUT optimization variables so that they can all be output at final time making them
easier to incorporate into DOC model simulations.

2024-06-06 small fix to optimization variables that are used to set the initial concentrations in the sat and 
deepsat zones

2024-06-30
Fixed two errors in the calculation of Optimization parameters used to calculate the mass balance of C of
Carbon
	Final Diff Meas Sim DOC Load - this compares the total sim decomposition to the total measured DOC export
	The error was the the measured DOC export was based on simulated stream flow and measured concentration.  
	It is fixed now be measured stream flow.  This could lead significant errors in the optimized decomposition
	
	Daily Load RMS -  This compares the simulated and measured daily DOC daily loads and was used in the 
	second mass balance check.  Error was that I forgot to prevent the calculation from occurring during
	during spin up when there were no daily measured loads.  I fixed this and also calculated a different 
	but similar variable inal Diff Meas Sim DOC Load2 that is more compatible to the calibration factor
	used in the first mass balance.
	
Also created two normalized objective functions to be used to optimize the Sat Zone storage and GW flow 
in a policy opt
	Relative Diff Stream DOC Conc
	Realtive Min Sat Zone C
	
2024-07-01 
Fixed calculation of Relative Diff Stream DOC Conc Reorganized the Opt view a bit.	Added two more optimization
parameters that allow the initial levels of available C in the Wetland runoff and surface soil runoff 
stores to be optimized, rather than starting from 0.  Removed some old equations regarding the earlier 
formulation of surface DOC loss that were in the text view but not in the sketch view

2024-07-26
Fixed mass balance 1 in optimization view to include the decomposition from wetlands
