		MIN((DEEP GW CAP-Deep Satzone),(Satzone+recharge-fast gwflow- deep seep))
		
		The second term can be thought of as the sat zone.  The additional components are \

		The first IF statement checks to see if the water in the satzone is \
		greater than the minimum storage definded by the coefficient Min Sat Zone \
		Storage and the potential withdrawal from the sat zone that day as defined \
		by Sat Deficit.If there is not enough water to meet this demand no other \
		calculations occur and deep percolation is 0. The second embeded IF is \
		used when there is enought water to support deep percolation Then the same \
		equation as in the original hydrology model is.  If the water (above the \
		Min Sat Zone Storage) is greater than the Deep Sat Deficit then the Deep \
		Sat Deficit is removed. Otherwise, all water up to the Min Sat Zone \
