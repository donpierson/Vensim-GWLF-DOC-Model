	~	DEEP GW CAP limits the amount of deep percolation. It can not exceed an amount that \
		is defined by the DEEP GW CAP. But as long as there is sufficient water in \
		the Satzone it will recharge the Deep SatZone to DEEP GW CAP. 
		NOTE if DEEP GW CAP is 0 The Deep Satzone will never get any water and deep \
		percolation will not occur
		
		
		In the Original Hydro model Equation
		MIN((DEEP GW CAP-Deep Satzone),(Satzone+recharge-fast gwflow- deep seep))
		
		The second term can be thought of as the sat zone.  The additional components are \
		added since the sat zone is a level and therefore the value of the \
		previous day.  
		
		New equation that allows a minimum amount of water storage in the sat zone.  
		
		IF THEN ELSE(Satzone>Min Sat Zone Storage+Deep Sat Deficit,MIN (Deep Sat Deficit, \
		(Satzone+recharge-fast gwflow-

		The first IF statement checks to see if the water in the satzone is \
		greater than the minimum storage definded by the coefficient Min Sat Zone \
		Storage and the potential withdrawal from the sat zone that day as defined \
		by Sat Deficit.If there is not enough water to meet this demand no other \
		calculations occur and deep percolation is 0. The second embeded IF is \
		used when there is enought water to support deep percolation Then the same \
		equation as in the original hydrology model is.  If the water (above the \
		Min Sat Zone Storage) is greater than the Deep Sat Deficit then the Deep \
		Sat Deficit is removed. Otherwise, all water up to the Min Sat Zone \
		storage is removed.
